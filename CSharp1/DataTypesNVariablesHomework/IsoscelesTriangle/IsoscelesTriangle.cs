//Write a program that prints an isosceles triangle of 9 copyright symbols ©, something like this:

//   ©

//  © ©

// ©   ©

//© © © ©

//Note: The © symbol may be displayed incorrectly at the console so you may need to change the console character encoding to UTF-8 and assign a Unicode-friendly font in the console.

//Note: Under old versions of Windows the © symbol may still be displayed incorrectly, regardless of how much effort you put to fix it.
